#ICT Pedagogy guide

Independance is better than dependance,

finding out is better than being told.

But explicit teaching has its place. 

Authentic tasks give work relavence,

Engaged is better than entertained.

Simple tasks give confidence.

Complex tasks with confidence give mastery.

Cross curricular links matter!

Educate to the aim, 

the aim is never the test.

A good huntsman will never say thankyou to a fox delivered.
