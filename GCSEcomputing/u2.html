<h1 id="activity1">Activity 1</h1>

<p>Starter Exercise. - work in pairs on this, but everybody needs to have every part of your paired code.</p>

<h2>Learning aims:</h2>
<p> See aims a,b,g,o,p,q,r</p>


<h2>Tasks</h2>
<p>Two variables a and b can be swapped by using a temporary variable to store an intermediate, This can be achieved by storing the contents of a in the temporary variable, storing the contents of b in a, and then storing the contents of the temporary variable back into b.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Rewrite the algorithm described as a flow chart</li>
    <li>Rewrite the algorithm described in pseudo code</li>
    <li>Create a test for your swap function.  Remember that you will need to choose suitable input values for your test, and work out what the outcomes should be.</li>
    <li>Write the function, and show that your test passes</li>
</ol>
<h2>What to hand in</h2>
<p>To show completion of this task you should submit a word document with the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your flow chart</li>
    <li>Your pseudo code</li>
    <li>Your test function (could be a screen shot of your code)</li>
    <li>Your function (again could be a screen shot)</li>
    <li>A screenshot showing successful running of your test.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note if you don't get it right first time - show the errors you made in your word document, and show the corrected version.</p>

<p>Bubble sort</p>
<p> Work in pairs - But not the same pairs as for activity 1</p>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8Kp-8OGwphY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h2>Learning aims:</h2>
<p>To be able to implement a bubble sort.  Also see aims a,b,g,h,i,o,p,q,r </p>
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<p>A bubble sort works by iterating accross a list, and swaping two elements if they are in the wrong order</p>
<ol>
    <li>Rewrite the algorithm described as a flow chart</li>
    <li>Rewrite the algorithm described in pseudo code</li>
    <li>Create a test for your swap function.  Remember that you will need to choose suitable input values for your test, and work out what the outcomes should be.</li>
    <li>Write the function, and show that your test passes</li>

<h1 id="activity3">Activity 3</h1>

<p>Selection sort</p>
<p> Work in pairs - But not the same pairs as for activity 1 or 2.</p>
<h2>Learning aims:</h2>

<p>To be able to implement a selection sort.  Also see aims a,b,g,h,i,o,p,q,r </p>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/f8hXR_Hvybo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>A selection sort works by traversing a list, removing the smallest item, in the first list, and placing it in a new list, then outputting the newly created list at the end.</p>
<h2>What to hand in</h2>
<p>To show completion of this task you should submit a word document with the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your pseudo code</li>
    <li>Your test function (could be a screen shot of your code)</li>
    <li>Your function (again could be a screen shot)</li>
    <li>A screenshot showing successful running of your test.</li>
</ul>

<p>Merge Sort</p>
<p> Work in pairs - But not the same pairs as for activity 1, 2, or 3.</p>
<h2>Learning aims:</h2>
<p>To be able to implement a merge sort.  Also see aims a,b,g,h,i,o,p,q,r </p>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/EeQ8pwjQxTM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p> A merge sort involves two stages.  firstly a list is recursively broken down into its component parts.  Then it is build up again, each merge creating a larger sorted list. <img src = 'images/ms algorithm.PNG'</p>
<p>This may take more than one function to acomplish.</p>
<h2>What to hand in</h2>
<p>To show completion of this task you should submit a word document with the following:</p>
<ul>
    
    <li>Your pseudo code</li>
    <li>Your test function (could be a screen shot of your code)</li>
    <li>Your function (again could be a screen shot)</li>
    <li>A screenshot showing successful running of your test.</li>
</ul>

<p>Comparing sorting algorithms</p>
<p> Work in pairs - But not the same pairs as for activity 1, 2, 3 or 4.</p>
<h2>Learning aims:</h2>
<p>To be able to compare merge, selection and bubble sorts.  Also see aims a,b,g,h,i,o,p,q,r </p>
<p>Your task here is to compare your three sorting algorithms. The key question here is what makes a 'good' algorithm, and how can you measure the 'goodness' of the algorithm.</p>
