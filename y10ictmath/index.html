<h2>Year 10 ICT in Mathematics</h2>

<p>This is the year 10 ICT curriculum for the academic year from Sept 2014. These units are taught by the mathematics department with support from the computing team.  These units are designed to be taught without the use of computers, with the exception of the final optional activity.</p>
<p>The optional activities can be done under supervision of a member of the computing department during Intervention periods.  These activities are particularly recommended for higher level GCSE students and GCSE computing students.</p>
<p>These units are written for the higher Level GCSE Unit, they will need a level of differenciation for Foundation students. Each unit should be approximately 5 hours.</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Fractions - Unit 3 (ICT U1)</li>
        <li> Collecting Data - Unit 6 (ICT U2)</li>
        <li> Perimeter and Area - Unit 12 (ICT U3)</li>
