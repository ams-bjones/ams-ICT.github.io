        <p>Databases are used to store data.  Data can be entered into a database, and it can be retrieved from a database.  Information is data which is organised into a more human readable format. There are two types of people concerned with databases.  Those that design databases, and those that use databases. You will already have used database theory whenever you have made a table to store your results in science, maths or geography. The purpose of this unit is to level up your skills in order that you can create databases with multiple tables, and become a more proficient user.</p>  
        <p>Databases can be visualised as a series of related tables of information. Each table stores information about a type of entity. The rows of each table store records - information about a specific entity. The columns of each table store information about one aspect of each entity. There are four basic commands which a database can perform once it is designed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create - that is make a record</li>
            <li>Retrieve - that is get information about a record</li>
            <li>Update - That is take stored information and enter new information in the same record.</li>
            <li>Delete - That is to remove the record from the database</li>
        </ul>

<p>The planets are interesting features of our solar system which we can use to make a database for.  We can use this database later to extract critical information to use later.</p>

<h2>Learning aims:</h2>

<ul>
    <li> Level 3 Data</li>
    <li>(L4) Performs searches using boolean and relational operators</li>
    <li>Create and edit data in a flat file database</li>
</ul>
<h2>The planets</h2>
<p>Our information about the planets comes from the following source <a href = 'http://www.bobthealien.co.uk/table.htm'/>http://www.bobthealien.co.uk/table.htm</a>.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Who wrote the source webpage?</li>
    <li>How can you tell they are an authority or not?</li>
    <li>When was the webpage last updated?</li>
</ol>
<p><a href = "http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/training/tables-the-building-blocks-of-databases-RZ006118141.aspx?section=9">Read this first.</a></p>
<p><a href = "http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/training/benefits-of-using-a-database-RZ006118141.aspx?section=2">Then this.</a></p>

The first step in designing a database is to design a set of facts.  a fact is a sentence that relates to a set of information.
<h3>Example</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The planet with the name ___ has a mass of ___ kg.</li>
    <li>The planet with the name ___ has a diameter of ___m.</li>
    <li>The planet with the name ___ has a density of ___ kg/m<sup>3</sup></li>
</ul>
Note that each of these "binary facts" goes with the same pattern. <quote>The <em>entity</em> with the <em>unique property</em> ___ has a <em>property</em> of ___</quote>
<ol>
    <li>What is the entity in each of the examples?</li>
    <li>What is the unique property in eack of the examples?</li>
    <li>What are the properties in each of the three examples?</li>
    <li>Write 4 more binary fact sentences from the tables provided.</li>
</ol>
<p>When we talk about databases - we call these properities "fields".  We call the field that is unique to each entity its "key"</p>

<p>The purpose of a key is to speed up searching for things.</p>
<p>In this activity you will prepare a flat file database. This is not too different to what you could achieve in Excel, and yes excell may be a better tool for what yuou achieve in this activity, but we will take this further in the next exercises.</p>
<h3>What to submit</h3>
<p>At the end of this activity you will need to upload the following evidence of completion. You should put all of this into a single word document.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A list of 8 binary facts, use the format above.</li>
    <li>A Conceptual Schema Diagram</li>
    <li>A Schema</li>
    <li>A Screen shot of your table design view.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you keep your original documentation, you will need this again later.</p>

<h3>Using the Database we have made so far.</h3>
<p>We are going to use the database you have constructed to make a form and a query. In the form we are going to create a calulated value.</p>
<h3>What to submit</h3>
<p>At the end of this activity you will need to upload the following evidence of completion. You should put all of this into a single word document.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A screenshot of your query</li>

<p>Guided Research</p>

<h2>Learning aims:</h2>

  <li>(data) defines datatypes - (real and boolean)</li>

</ul>
<h3>Data and information</h3>
<p>Data in a database has a type.  This gives the computer some idea of how it is to store the data that you give it.  <a href = 'http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/training/fields-of-data-RZ006118141.aspx?section=10'>Read this for an intro to data types</a></p>

<h3>Task</h3>
<p> Read the following <a href = 'http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/access-help/introduction-to-data-types-and-field-properties-HA010341783.aspx?CTT=1'>web page about data types. </a> Then answer the following questions in a word document.  Upload your word document</p>

  <li>(data) understands the use and need of an index key in a database.</li>
  </ul>
  </ul>

</ul>
<h3>What about the moons?</h3>
<p> So far we have used a simple flat database.  A flat database is based on only one table. We can make much more use of our database if we use a relational structure.  In this exercise we will expand our database by expanding it to encompas a second type of entity.</p>
<p>New entiry types require new tables.  We are going to have to design a new table which relates to moons.  This is very simmilar to the process we did for creating the table about planets except that we will be including one extra field which links our moon to the correct planet.</p>
<p>When we have done this we can do some cool things, We will make a new type of form, and report that deals with the moons to demonstrate some of these features.</p>
<h3>What to hand in.</h3>
<p>Please submit the following in a single word document</p>
<ul>
    <li>A set of binary facts related to the moons.</li>
    <li>A conceptual schema diagram including the moons.</li>
    <li>A schema</li>
    <li>Screenshots of your database design tables</li>
    <li>Screenshots of your forms and queries.</li>
