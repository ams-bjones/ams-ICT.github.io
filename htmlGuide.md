#HTML Guide
##Aims
The aims for this technical guide are to encourage techincal consistency within, and between pages on this site.
##Page structure
A page has structure as laid out in the template document.  From time to time changes to the template are necessary. Updates to the template should be made programatically, and should update all other pages.
Generally all pages share the same style sheets - one for mobile devices, one for print, and one for screen.  Adjustments to these styles should be minimal.  Inline CSS is permitted but discouraged.  It is better to create a class in the style sheets for structural pages, in order that they can be used in other pages in a consistent manner.
The overarching aim here is for consistency of format.  
## Block Tags
The h1 tag should be used for the main heading on the page, and at the top level of a section only.
The h2 tag should be used for the first level of sub heading, on page and section elements.
The h3 tag should be used for subsections under a h2 title
The p tag should delineate all paragraphs.
##Inline Tags
It is better to start a new section, than use a hr tag.
If it better not to use a br element tag
The em tag should be used to add emphasis to words only, never to make a heading.
The strong tag should only be used minimally to add emphasis to words only, never to make a heading.
