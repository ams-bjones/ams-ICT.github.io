        <p>Word processing is the creation, editing and publication of digital artefacts which are based on formatted text.  We use a word porcessor in school to write up assignments, essays, magazine articles, letters, plays and many other uses.  In this unit we will also introduce you to the file system, and how to use this to your advantage.</p>

<h3><strong>Task 1</strong></h3>
<b><font color="#000000">HOW DO YOU COMMUNICATE WITH THE COMPUTER?</font></b><br><br>
In the windows environment you can communicate with the computer using a <strong>Graphical User Interface</strong> (GUI -pronounced Gooey). This means you give instructions to the computer by using a mouse to click on icons, tabs and buttons. In Microsoft Word there is a <strong>ribbon</strong> which goes across the window. This is where you can find a set of tabs, a series of buttons, icons and controls called commands.

</strong>An icon is a small symbol or picture that represents a series of instructions or programs.

<h3><b>Task 2 - Writting a covering letter for a Job</b></h3>

<b><font color="#660066">Cover Letter Tips:</font></b><br><br>
<b><u>The basics</u></b><br>
Always send a cover letter as part of any job application.<br><br>
Be neat and tidy: type your letter on unmarked, white A4 paper.<br><br>
Keep it concise: ideally just one page.<br><br>
Attention to detail: ensure there are no spelling or grammatical mistakes (especially the correct job title and name of who you are writing to).<br>
Make sure you include your contact phone and address details.<br><br>
Be professional, positive and confident.<br><br>
Bullet points are great to describe your key skills / achievements but remember you are writing a formal letter. Most of your letter should be written in full sentences and split into relevant paragraphs.<br><br><br>
<b><u>What to say</u></b><br>
Include where you saw the job advertised and the vacancy reference number if applicable.<br><br>
Describe why you are interested in this job.<br><br>
Include highlights or key achievements from your background but remember you don’t need to repeat lists of responsibilities from your CV.<br><br>
Make it relevant to the job you’re applying for: you need to show how your skills, experience, and qualifications match what they are looking for. (Refer back to their job advertisement or job description).<br><br>
Don’t forget that any skills gained through education, training, work experience, voluntary work and/or community activities might also be relevant.<br><br>
Cover off any other details as applicable: for example, your willingness to relocate if you live in a different town from where the job is based.<br><br>
Confirm you would appreciate the opportunity to be interviewed. Say if you are going to be unavailable during the likely interview process timeframe.<br><br><br>
