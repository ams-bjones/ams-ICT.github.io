Please keep activities in <section> tags. (See spreadsheets unit for example)  
Use the spreadsheets module as a style guide.  

Formatting changes should be kept in the CSS styles sheets located in the styles folder.  Images should be kept in a dedicated folder for each unit. 
Videos should be uploaded to youtube and linked into.
The document should be written for students as an audience.  
The "header" section should include the reasons for studying this unit.
A nab section should be included which allows students to jump to the section they are on.
Each section should have an id of the format "a1" etc.  This allows linking directly to each section both from the nab bar, and from the moodle.
The footer section should be left as is, although please add your name as a contributor.
